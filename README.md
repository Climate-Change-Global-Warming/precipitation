# Climat Analysis

Analizing data about climate changes for the main project [Climate Data Central Biro]

This part is concerning just the part od **the impact of precipitations on Climate change on the globe.**

## Rainfall Impact on Climate change on the globe

### SPI - Standard precipitation index

The **Standardized Precipitation Index** (SPI; McKee 1993) is the number of standard deviations that observed cumulative precipitation deviates from the climatological average.

To compute the index, a long-term time series of precipitation accumulations over the desired time scale are used to estimate an appropriate probability density function.
